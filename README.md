## Summary

Changing a black and white photo to colorize and make it accessible. Being able to take in older pictures and add some colorizations to peek into the past with the lense of the person who actually took the picture

## MVP

A FastAPI back end. React front end using OpenCV/ML/Neural networks to colorize/de-colorize black and white photos.
Photo persistence on a DB for users to come back and reference or download.

## Stretch

Alternate photo styles? generalized enhancement/cartoony style/painted, ML with different pre-trained models to stylize the image
Social aspects? Vote and comment on other users' photos
Open a gallery of photos the tool has processed. **anonymized** maybe allow the user to opt their photos in or out of this portion.
